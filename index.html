			Here is the part where I am supposed to describe myself !
			After 2 hours of intense staring competition with my laptop, this is what I came up with.

			Hi, I am an undergrad student at I.I.T. Kanpur majoring in physics who believes in the philosophy of open source and will be happy to collaborate with you on any interesting project. When not staring at some code you could find me in the chess club solving chess puzzles or at the basketball field. If there is an exam tomorrow you might find me sleeping in the library.
